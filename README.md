# GMPLS with RSVP Simulation Project

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is a simulation-based implementation of **Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)** with **Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)** using **OMNeT++**.  
It demonstrates **dynamic path computation**, **label distribution**, and **resource reservation** for both optical and packet-switched networks, focusing on **QoS-aware traffic engineering** and **efficient bandwidth utilization**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
- Implementation of GMPLS signaling and control mechanisms.
- RSVP-based path setup and teardown.
- Dynamic bandwidth allocation and QoS support.
- Simulation of both optical and packet-switched scenarios.
- Configurable network topology for testing.

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies & Tools
- **OMNeT++ 6.1**
- C++ (for module implementation)
- NED language (for network topology description)
- XML/INI configuration files
